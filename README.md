### 🔧 What I’ve Worked On:
- **Data Structures in Java**: Built custom implementations of Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Trees for simulations, sorting visualizations, and basic games
- **Elephant Conservation Simulator**: Applied simulation modeling to optimize conservation decisions under constraints — focused on probability and population data
- **PwC Nonprofit Data Consulting Externship**: Analyzed donor data using Python/Excel, built ML models for donor segmentation and behavior prediction, and delivered data-driven recommendations to enhance fundraising strategy.
